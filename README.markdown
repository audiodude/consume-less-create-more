# What is ConsumeLessCreateMore.com?

I feel I am much too easily satisfied by the mass produced pleasures of consumer 
goods. Junk TV, junk food, junk living. I feel so much better when I create 
something, even something small and meaningless like the website.

I want to remind myself and others to stop being satisfied with the less.

I am definitely not anti-capitalism, I think it's the best practical, scalable 
economic system.

If you have recommendations on quotes to add or remove please share them. I'd 
really like it if other people got involved in quote selection.

Thanks for looking, go create something.
